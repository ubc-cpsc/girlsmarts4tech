# Starter Project: Hungry Panda

This README file explains how to set up this project on your personal machine. You can play the game here: https://ubc-cpsc.github.io/girlsmarts4tech/Programming/2018/completed/.

## Download project

Go to https://github.com/ubc-cpsc/girlsmarts4tech/releases/latest and download starter.zip or completed.zip. Open the zip file by double clicking it if you are on Mac (a folder with the same name should appear). If you are on Windows, right click on the zip file and choose Extract All (see [instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files)).

## Required software

We will need to use a few things. When installing, install the version that is stable, or recommended for most users. Also, when you simply click download most of the time your system will be detected and a suitable version will be automatically installed, so don't worry too much. When you have to choose a version, make sure you download the version for your system (Mac, Windows, or Linux).

- Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) on your machine by opening the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) page

- Install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Install ESLint package: in Visual Studio Code, go to View -> Extensions, and then search ESLint, click the first result, click install, and click reload when installation finishes

## Set up and start coding

1. Open the project you downloaded in Visual Studio Code: File -> Open... -> Choose starter or completed

2. In Visual Studio Code, open terminal: View -> Integrated Terminal, and a new thing should pop up

3. In the terminal that just popped up, type: `npm -v`. If something like `5.5.1` (the numbers might be different) shows up, go to the next step. If `bash: npm: command not found` shows up, refer to the Required Software section and install npm again.

4. In terminal, type: `npm install`

5. In terminal, type: `npm run mac` if you are on Mac, `npm run win` if you are on Windows

6. Open Chrome, go to http://localhost:8888 and you should see the game canvas

7. Go back to Visual Studio Code if you need to change anything, save the changes (Control+S if on Windows, Command+S if on Mac), refresh the web page in Chrome, and you should see the changes

8. Happy coding :smile:
